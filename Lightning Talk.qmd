# Lesson Overview

We had two big topics: ML and DL

*Each session took place on an afternoon for 4-5.*

## Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit Learn
- Nelis introduced us to the topic 
- Mike built on that 
- Regression and Classification

## Introduction to Deep Learning
- Nidhi switched from generic ML to Deep Learning (DL)
- Some aspects (there are more:)   
  - ML: stoachstic; similar if not the same result
  - DL: non-convex and complex
  - DL: only estimated
  - DL: uses neural networks
  - DL: tends to use way more resources (CPU/GPU)
  - ML: Can still solve a lot of real-world issues using limilted resources



## How we deviated from 'The Carpentries' and why
- Google Colab vs. ~~locally installed Jupyter Notebooks~~ or ~~Plain Vanilla Python~~
  - Do all use Colab 'in the real world' all the time? No!
  	- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  	- Python locally installed
    	- Virtual Environment
    	- `pip install`
  	- using GPU/[Nectar](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/research-software-and-computing/advanced-compute/nectar-research-cloud)/...

# Recommended next steps
- This was a lot of content!
- Try to integrate it/go through the examples in the near future
  - schedule it!
  - not: *I will do that one day*; that day never comes!
- Please fill out our [Survey](https://auckland.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7QKm5JodbHrRaWW), now!
- join [Hacky Hour](https://research-hub.auckland.ac.nz/digital-research-skills/hacky-hour)

# Kaggle
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is an AI community aimed at getting a better understanding/practice.
There are competitions that we can recommend:

- Regression:
  - [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) :house:
- Classification:
  - [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data) :ship:
  - [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data) üõ∞Ô∏è :ship:
  - [mnist digit recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) :pen: (probably quite a bit harder just because of the data input/processing)
  
(Alternative to Kaggle: [Scikit Toy Datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html))

# Good luck

- Stay in touch with us on your ML/DL/AI journey [CeR](https://eresearch.auckland.ac.nz/)
- the time is now!
- While we can't predict what is going to happen in the AI space, we can tell you from experience that we get more researchers making ML-requests almmost daily
