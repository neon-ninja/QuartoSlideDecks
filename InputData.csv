User1,Engineering,Windows,100,100,100,50,100,80,organized and step-by-step instructions + many people were online to help the students with all of their questions,separate the students who have no idea of coding from the ones who are familiar,Promoter,10,"organize in series, like elementary, intermediate, advanced"
User2,Biomedical and clinical sciences,Windows,100,100,100,82,68,84,"One of the teachers read allowed each line of code word for word as he was typing it, this made it really easy to type along too. He also described each of the functions/whatever ever he typed in meant as he did it.","Kind of opposite to above - but given there is less of an emphasis on actually knowing what to type in and more on what the code actually means/why you are using it - then have a more streamlined/obvious copy and pasting of the sections of code, then stopping to describe it. A lot of time was spent typing out code and then stopping/starting to work out where the error in the code was. I feel like a lot of time could have been saved if we were all just copying/pasting the same line of code. This would give more time to describe what each line of code is doing, and give the students more time to write down what each line of code is doing. I think having those kinds of details written down is important for when students want to go back and edit the code to suit their data.",Passive,8,I think possibly separating out the python/machine learning/deep learning into different courses based on needs. Then spending time at the end of each day helping people write scripts for their own data â€“ that would be super useful!
User3,Biomedical and clinical sciences,Windows,100,100,100,80,50,60,"The encouragement to speak up if you get behind was really great, and should be continued","3/4 of the teachers kept a really good pace, but one of the teachers was quite quick and switched to using a different platform which slowed down which meant I had difficulties keeping up. If you ask a group of beginners mixed with more experienced learners which platform they'd like to use, then the most experienced person is usally the first to speak up and doesn't necessarily reflect the rest of the classes views. Also sticking to the content that's in the class notes was important as sometimes you need to copy code from the class instructions to keep up or fix an error when you get behind",Promoter,10,"This workshop was really great, it was such a difficult thing to teach to beginners and the teachers were very skilled at making it easy enough to follow along. Typing along with instructors is a great way to learn, although sometimes it's hard to listen and type so you miss parts of the explanation that comes after "
User4,Engineering,Windows,85,85,100,100,80,70,Explanation and coding in real time so usual mistakes can be seen and be taught how to handle as well. It gives this idea to the learners as well that little coding mistakes always happen and it's not something to fret over. It also gives an idea of how errors should be handled and analyzed.,"Perhaps more time for the workshop, more spaced out sessions as well. The material online can also be made more detailed so that if we miss one thing, we can easily retrace where we kind of got lost. Also comments on every little code component might be helpful. As someone who codes using matlab, I still find some codes a bit confusing and I would love to understand how each little part works and their contribution/pros/cons over other forms of code that does exactly the same thing.",Promoter,10,Just more time for each session and more spaced out. I think that would really help students take in more fo the lessons and be more ready for the next session.
User5,Built environment and design,Windows,50,70,60,60,20,70,"maybe add some quick group exercise session or quiz, to apply the learnings.",the pace sometimes is a bit too fast to follow.,Passive,8,
User6,Biomedical and clinical sciences,macOS,100,98,97,94,98,100,I like the carpentry style workshop with the easy to follow instructions and code,improve break schedule - you need a bit of a longer one in between and a couple of short bio breaks. ,Promoter,10,
User7,Economics,Windows,100,82,82,80,71,72,some research paper example?,five days a week seems to intensive for me to digest all the new information to me. I hope if one lesson a week and in five continuous week will be more suitable for me. ,Promoter,10,
User8,Chemical sciences,Linux,95,100,100,80,60,80,The live coding and follow along,"Would prefer the Python Basics in a separate workshop, or allow the people who are already familiar with Python to skip these lessons. It is a lot of wasted idle time otherwise.",Detractor,4,"If the Python basics were separate or shortened, more time could be dedicated to the actual ML content, as it felt a bit rushed due to time constraints, particularly the sections that we never ended up covering."

User10,Biomedical and clinical sciences,Windows,60,40,60,70,60,50,Information that was delivered at a slower pace,Explaining concepts with an introductory audience in mind,Passive,7,
User11,Engineering,Windows,81,100,71,84,100,100,Started from the scratch. ,More effective if give participants tasks to do. For example 5 to 10 minutes time after each lesson so participants do what they have learned on some data and then instructors check and debug. It could be done in separate zoom rooms.,Passive,8,Thank you
User12,Biological sciences,macOS,100,95,95,90,85,95,"the overall workshop structure was very good organised, keep as is",evenly distributed break times 45min workshop followed with 5min break and longer break 15-25min at half time. Also some instructors did not always follow the carpentry material (different code and examples) this makes it hard to follow if one is losing track due to e.g. a technical issue etc.,Promoter,9,"best not to introduce alternative apps during the workshop, e.g. using VS code instead of Google colab. But it is always good to name them, maybe at the end of the session rather than switched mid lesson ;)"

User14,Biomedical and clinical sciences,Windows,100,100,81,100,50,50,"I found it really useful learning the python syntax, it'd be very helpful to learn more functions.","The workshop was quite fast-paced, would be helpful if a bit more time were spent on the basics of python.",Promoter,10,"It was really helpful, thank you!"
User15,Biomedical and clinical sciences,Windows,90,100,80,80,60,70,Was applications based.,More explaination for the coding and the reasoning for carrying out the code. A lot of lingo was used and it was hard to follow at times. ,Passive,7,The pacing of the workshop was very quick and perhaps changing the structure of the course would be good.
User16,Engineering,Windows,80,85,90,90,85,80,"How do we apply these ML techniques on the different filed of Engineering? If possible, can we have some examples for different filed?","If the teaching speed can be slowed down, the learning will be more effective.",Promoter,10,"If possible, can teachers please give us some clues that where (database, webs) can we find some data for training our own model from different filed in Engineering? Because in the most of the time, we do not know where to get some raw data."
